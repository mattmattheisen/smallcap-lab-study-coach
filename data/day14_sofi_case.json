      "question": "If SOFI shows 'Regime: Bear, Confidence: 56%, Status: Transition' and your threshold=70%, your sizing should be:",
      "options": [
        "Full Kelly",
        "Half Kelly",
        "Zero or reduced to a token size",
        "Double Kelly to compensate"

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Below-threshold confidence → no/low size until regime stabilizes."

      "answer": 0.0667,
      "tolerance": 0.01,
      "explanation": "f*=(1.2*0.52−0.48)/1.2 = (0.624−0.48)/1.2 ≈ 0.12; wait—check: (0.624−0.48)=0.144; 0.144/1.2=0.12. Answer ≈ 0.12."

      "answer_text": "1) Confidence below threshold; 2) Transition state increases uncertainty; we preserve capital until edge strengthens."
