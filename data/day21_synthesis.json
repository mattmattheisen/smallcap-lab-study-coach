        "We buy what we like",
        "We screen small caps, infer regimes with HMM, aggregate signals into an edge, then size via fractional Kelly",

      "answer": 0.1077,
      "tolerance": 0.01,
      "explanation": "(0.702−0.46)/1.3 = 0.242/1.3 ≈ 0.186 → check arithmetic; correct: 0.242/1.3 ≈ 0.186. Use 0.186."
