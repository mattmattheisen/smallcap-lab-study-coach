        "Because variance/volatility drag and tail risk reduce geometric growth",
        "Because EV is always negative",
        "Because prices are random",
        "Because spreads are zero"

      "explanation": "Compounding depends on geometric mean; high variance can lower CAGR even with positive EV."

      "tolerance": 0.001,
      "explanation": "EV = 0.55*0.10 − 0.45*0.05 = 0.055 − 0.0225 = 0.0325 (If using net profit basis). If using simple expectation of return, 3.25%. (Accept 0.0325±0.002)"
