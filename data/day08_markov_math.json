      "question": "What does each row of a transition matrix represent in a 3-state HMM (Bear, Sideways, Bull)?",
      "options": [
        "Probabilities of moving from that row's state to each column's state next step",

        "Volatility of each state",
        "Sharpe ratio of each state"

      "explanation": "Row i lists P(state_t+1 = j | state_t = i) over all j; row sums to 1."

      "question": "Given a simplified 2-state chain with P(S→S)=0.8, P(S→B)=0.2, P(B→S)=0.4, P(B→B)=0.6, what is the stationary probability of state S? (Solve π = πP, π_S + π_B = 1)",
      "answer": 0.6667,
      "tolerance": 0.02,
      "explanation": "Solve: π_S = 0.8π_S + 0.4π_B ⇒ 0.2π_S = 0.4(1−π_S) ⇒ 0.2π_S = 0.4 − 0.4π_S ⇒ 0.6π_S = 0.4 ⇒ π_S ≈ 0.6667."
