      "question": "Why might the HMM segment bull phases into shorter runs compared to bears?",
      "options": [
        "Upside bursts increase variance/kurtosis, prompting the model to carve separate high-vol states",
        "Bull markets always have lower returns",
        "The model is biased toward bears",
        "Because volume is ignored"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Sudden positive jumps can produce distinct state statistics, splitting bulls into shorter regimes."

      "question": "If P(Bull→Bull)=0.79, what is the expected length (in days) of a bull run? Use E[length]=1/(1−p).",
      "answer": 4.7619,
      "tolerance": 0.1,
      "explanation": "E[length] ≈ 1/(1−0.79) ≈ 4.76 days (memoryless approximation)."
