      "question": "Why can a '3 bullish : 1 bearish' pattern count still fail to produce a buy signal?",
      "options": [
        "Because the HMM regime and confidence can overrule raw pattern counts",
        "Because bullish patterns never work",
        "Because counts must be exactly 4:0",
        "Because pattern names are arbitrary"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Pattern counts are context; the probabilistic regime and confidence determine edge."

      "question": "If 25% of bullish engulfings historically succeed and you saw 3 of them in 30 days, what is the naive probability of at least one success (independent events)?",
      "answer": 0.578,
      "tolerance": 0.02,
      "explanation": "1 - (1-0.25)^3 = 1 - 0.75^3 â‰ˆ 0.578. (Independence is an approximation.)"
