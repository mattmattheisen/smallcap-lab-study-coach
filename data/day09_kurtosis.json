      "question": "High kurtosis in a regime implies:",
      "options": [
        "More probability mass in the center and tails (more extreme moves)",
        "Lower variance than a normal distribution",
        "Errors in the data feed",
        "Stationarity is guaranteed"

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Leptokurtic distributions have fatter tails and a sharper peak than Gaussian."

      "question": "If a regime has daily mean 0.1% and standard deviation 1.2%, what is the z-score of a +3% day? (Use sd=0.012)",
      "answer": 2.4167,
      "tolerance": 0.05,
      "explanation": "z = (0.03 − 0.001)/0.012 ≈ 2.4167; fat tails mean such events are more common than Gaussian predicts."

      "answer_text": "Because extreme moves occur more often than Gaussian assumptions imply, stops can be hit unexpectedly."
